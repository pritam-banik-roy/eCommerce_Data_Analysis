## Overview
This project leverages customer and transaction data to derive insights, build predictive models, and group customers into meaningful clusters. It aims to assist businesses in improving their marketing strategies and enhancing customer engagement.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes three CSV files:  

1. **Customers.csv**  
   - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.  
   - `CustomerName`: Name of the customer.  
   - `Region`: Customer's continent.  
   - `SignupDate`: Customer signup date.  

2. **Products.csv**  
   - `ProductID`: Unique product identifier.  
   - `ProductName`: Name of the product.  
   - `Category`: Product category.  
   - `Price`: Product price in USD.  

3. **Transactions.csv**  
   - `TransactionID`: Unique transaction identifier.  
   - `CustomerID`: ID of the customer.  
   - `ProductID`: Product ID involved in the transaction.  
   - `TransactionDate`: Date of the transaction.  
   - `Quantity`: Quantity of the product purchased.  
   - `TotalValue`: Total transaction value.  
   - `Price`: Price of the product sold.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted EDA to analyze customer behavior and transaction patterns.  
- Key business insights include:
  1. Identification of high-spending regions.  
  2. Popular product categories.  
  3. Seasonal trends in transaction activity.  
  4. Customer acquisition patterns based on signup dates.  
  5. Correlation between total spending and transaction frequency.

#### Deliverables:
- `FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb` (Code for EDA)
- `FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf` (Report of insights)

---

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
Developed a lookalike model to find similar customers based on profile and transaction history.  
- Used features like region, transaction behavior, and spending patterns.  
- Generated similarity scores and recommended the top 3 similar customers for each customer.

#### Deliverables:
- `FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb` (Model development code)  
- `FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv` (Top 3 lookalike customers with scores)  

---

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
Performed customer segmentation using clustering techniques to group customers with similar behaviors.  
- Used the KMeans clustering algorithm.  
- Evaluated clusters using the Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index) and Silhouette Score.  

#### Results:
- **Number of Clusters**: 4  
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: 0.865 (indicating good separation and compactness).  
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.374  

#### Deliverables:
- `FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb` (Clustering code)  
- `FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf` (Clustering report with metrics)
